‚è≥ TimeCast: Forecasting with ARIMA, LSTM & Prophet

TimeCast is a forecasting project using ARIMA, LSTM, and Facebook Prophet for time series prediction. Deployed with Streamlit, it enables interactive visualization, model comparison, and real-time forecasting on custom datasets.

üìå Overview

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using three popular models:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)

Facebook Prophet

A Streamlit app is included for interactive forecasting, allowing users to upload datasets, select models, and visualize predictions.

üöÄ Features

Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

Forecasting with ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet.

Evaluation metrics for model comparison.

Interactive Streamlit web app.

Support for custom datasets (CSV).
